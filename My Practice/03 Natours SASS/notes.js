//* check box hack:

// what makes that work is the so called checkbox hack.

// So how does that work?

// Well do you remember,

// in the other lecture about the form.

// So down here

// with the radio buttons.

// Remember this one here?

// So what we had here was a radio button

// connected to a label.

// And when we clicked on a label,

// then the radio button would become selected, okay.

// And that's the same thing that we're gonna do right now

// but except the radio button,

// we're gonna use a checkbox.

// So basically, the three steps for this to work

// is to first have a checkbox,

// which will be hidden later,

// then second,

// have a label connected to that checkbox,

// which is where we click.

// And as you can guess, that will be the button here.

// And then the third step is to reveal

// the entire navigation here in the background

// as soon as the checkbox becomes checked.

// And we can use the checked pseudo class in CSS
