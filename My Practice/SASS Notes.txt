Please note that in Windows, you should use forward slashes / instead of backslashes \ when navigating directories in Git Bash.

you should be in the directory that contains your package.json file when you run npm run compile:sass. This is because npm run scripts are defined in your package.json file, and npm needs to be able to find this file to know what scripts are available.

If your package.json file is located in the 04 Layout directory, then you should change your directory to 04 Layout before running the command:

npm run compile:sass

If the terminal doesn’t return to the command prompt after you run this command, it means that node-sass is still running in watch mode. It’s waiting for changes to your Sass file, and it will recompile your CSS every time it detects a change12.

If you want to stop node-sass from watching your file, you can press Ctrl + C in your terminal12. This will stop the process and return you to the command prompt.
